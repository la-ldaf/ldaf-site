// Since we can't set a custom color for $theme-link-visited-color in the
//   USWDS settings in src/app.scss, we need a bit more specific to override
//   the default value.
// Additionally, there are a ton of places where we never want to display a
//   link as visited, such as links rendered as buttons, links in the primary
//   and secondary nav in the header, and links in the side nav.

//   link being a child of an element with the 'usa-dark-background' class.
//   This seems overly restrictive, so we'll set up the alternate style to be
//   independent of its parent element.
