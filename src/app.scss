/* For some reason the border between the header and the rest of the page is
    placed on the next sibling of the header, but only if it's a .usa-section
    or <main>, presuambly since those are full-width elements. Since there's no
    comments or guidance around this we'll override this rule and apply it to
    the bottom of the header itself, which seems like a more sane approach.
